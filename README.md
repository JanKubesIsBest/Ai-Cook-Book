**AI wrappers, the future of all products!** 

Just kidding, but this is my shot at the AI wrappers battlefield. 

Have you ever thought about making a meal for yourself? Something original, made from ingredients in your fridge, that youâ€™d love to eat right now?

Searching for meals like this is almost impossible. So, use cook-book-ai!

## How app looks
Search for your meal:
<img width="1554" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce4bc9ed-7f62-453c-a936-3901fb7627c4" />
<img width="1554" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de2e8d4-d40a-4360-97ef-6f4722af5151" />

Enjoy the full recipe and search for additional info. Occasionally, you might want to change the entire recipe *(this might happen when the AI suggests store-bought items, like **nuggets**. You might want to make your own nuggets, which requires rewriting the entire recipe)*.

## What are the plans for the project in the future?
I definitely want to upload this version to the cloud, do a bit of marketing, and see if it achieves at least some success *(meaning Iâ€™d use it regularly ðŸ¤£)*.

Then, Iâ€™d like to develop an iOS app, and later an iPad app, since I think that that's what iPad is intended for: simple, every day tasks, preferably on native app *(because using web apps on iPad is pain)*.
